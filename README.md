# Refactor code challenge week-1
## Description

This project is the weekly challenge of the week 1.
The project is to improve the accessibility for users and refactor the code to make it more efficient, maintainable and easy to understand.
- I have written a concise and descriptive title for the website.
- The heading attributes were checked and ordered in sequence.
- I have added ALT attributes to images and icons. 
- I have added semantic elements to HTML creating a logical structure.
- I have created classes or IDs where it was required.
- I have improved the logic of the styles.

I have learned in this project that :

- Alt text often needs to be written only on images and icons that are non-decorative. If your image has a purpose or conveys a message, you need alt text. If it’s a background pattern or icons that are used decoratively, no alt tag is required.
- Any HTML element (like div, input, nav, body, etc) can have both “id” and “class” together at the same time. The only difference here is that “id” can have only one unique value and “class” can have more than one.
